        <span> We started LOTUS back in June of 2017 hoping to create a fun spot for users who enjoy the same aesthetic we do. We spent time advancing our skills in Lua, Blender, and graphic design through-out this project. Though this project has been on hiatus and is unlikely to be updated, we will always appreciate the skills we've gained and the community we've formed from this experience!</span>
